# fluid_design

Plan - 1hr 30mins on each section.

1. Set up a repository and initialise to git.
2. Create the basic layout (columns, icons, headings).
3. Complete core functionality - buttons. 
4. Make sure there is basic responsiveness and fluidity here.

5. Once layout is complete, spend the rest of the time on CSS and responsiveness.
